# Task1-Academic-Management-System
Design and develop an Academic Management System using SQL. The projects should involve three tables 
1.StudentInfo 
2. CoursesInfo 
3.EnrollmentInfo.

The Aim is to create a system that allows for managing student information and course enrollment.

# Academic Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive SQL-based Academic Management System designed to manage student information, course details, and enrollment records efficiently.

## Database Structure

### Tables
1. **StudentInfo** - Stores student personal and contact information
2. **CoursesInfo** - Contains course and instructor details
3. **EnrollmentInfo** - Manages student course enrollments with foreign key relationships

## Features

### 1. Database Creation
- Created three interconnected tables with proper constraints
- Implemented foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Structured schema for academic data management

### 2. Data Management
- Sample data insertion for all tables
- Student records with complete contact information
- Course catalog with instructor assignments
- Enrollment tracking system

### 3. Student Information Retrieval
- Query student details and contact information
- Retrieve enrollment status for individual students
- List courses for specific students
- Fetch course information with instructor details
- Multi-course information queries

### 4. Reporting and Analytics
- Count of students enrolled in each course
- Student lists for specific courses
- Enrollment statistics per instructor
- Identification of students in multiple courses
- Course popularity ranking by enrollment numbers

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Language:** SQL

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- Database and table creation
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- INSERT operations
- SELECT queries with filtering
- JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, GROUP BY)
- Sorting and ordering (ORDER BY)
- Subqueries

## Project Files
- `TaskA_Academic_mgmt_system.sql` - Complete SQL code with all tasks
- Screenshots folder containing output images for all queries

## How to Use
1. Execute the database creation script first
2. Run the data insertion script to populate tables
3. Execute retrieval queries to view student information
4. Run analytical queries for reporting insights

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding relational database design
- Implementing referential integrity with foreign keys
- Writing complex SQL queries with multiple joins
- Performing data analysis using aggregate functions
- Generating reports from structured data
